# DeepLearningAI-car

This application creates an enviorment for a AI car model that then learns over generations to train a model that learns how to drive itself confidently. This model uses genetic algoritms and
Neural Networking. This program also uses javascript and html. In order to run this program put all files in a folder and run the .html file.

Main calls other classes and functions to mainly set up an enviorment and a car, car sets up car class, and controls are the control attributes to move said car.
index.html and style.css are to create a fancy web page for said car (run .html file with other files to start car). road creates a road for our enviorment, sensor class gives the car a way to see and collect
information in order to gain information for our car and the neural network. utils and visualizer are helper functions for mathy algortihms and a visualizer for our neural network. Lastly neural network. 

More so, this program is "complete", although I plan to build upon what I have, as most of this was learned in a online video I found about neural networking and I want to build more upon this.
